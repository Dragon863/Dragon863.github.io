                    Rooting involves obtaining the highest level of permissions on a computer system. There has always
                    been a large community of Android users looking to root their devices, whether it is for
                    performance, privacy, compatibility or other reasons. Since the Amazon Echo is also based on
                    Android, it makes sense that people would also be looking for a way to root it. In my <a
                        href="https://dragon863.github.io/blog/alexa.html" class="link underline">previous
                        post</a>
                    , I described pulling Wi-Fi passwords from Amazon Echos using an exploit known as
                    amonet. Thanks to a debug feature implemented by Lab126 (Amazon's hardware development company) it
                    is now possible to obtain a tethered root on the device. Thanks to strong security practices
                    enforced by the company such as a chain of trust from the beginning of the boot process, this should
                    not be a major issue. However, it is a great opportunity for people wanting to run their own
                    software on the device (such as open source voice assistants). I have provided a CLI and two
                    examples in my code here: one is a <a
                        href="https://github.com/Dragon863/EchoCLI/blob/main/internal/spyserver.py"
                        class="link underline">web server</a>
                    and <a href="https://github.com/Dragon863/EchoCLI/blob/main/shell/spy.sh"
                        class="link underline">client</a>
                    which records and uploads microphone data
                    from the device, and one which acts as a <a
                        href="https://github.com/Dragon863/EchoCLI/blob/main/shell/led.sh"
                        class="link underline">notification indicator</a>
                    for Home Assistant.
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-size:32px" class="bold">How did we get here?</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                    As I described previously, the amonet exploit can be used to read from and write to the internal
                    eMMC storage. This allows the firmware and OS to be dumped and analysed. After I discovered this, I
                    came across a very helpful user called <a
                        href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/j10hx40r.11878441/" class="link underline">j10hx40r</a>
                    on XDA developers who
                    had already managed to root
                    the echo by patching the little kernel. This was accomplished by changing a value which is passed to
                    a function checking if the device is an Amazon internal “engineering” device. This, in turn, allows
                    us to use the fastboot function “fos_flags” (fos referring to FireOS) to enable features such as ADB
                    as root or disabling DM-verity which verifies if the system partition has been tampered with, and
                    selinux which manages permissions. However, after modifying the little kernel, we will find that the
                    device no longer boots, as the chain of trust is broken.

                <h4 style="font-size:32px" class="bold">What is a chain of trust?</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                    The recent amazon echo devices running fireOS 5 and 6 (based on Android 5 and 7.2 respectively)
                    employ a chain of trust to verify the integrity of booted software. When the device boots, it
                    verifies that the preloader, a form of bootloader, is signed with Amazon’s signing keys which are
                    burned into the processor’s eFuses. The preloader then verifies that the next step of the boot
                    process, the little kernel, is signed, which then checks the android boot image. In order to root
                    the device, we need to break the chain. Luckily for us, the <a
                        href="https://github.com/amonet-kamakiri/kamakiri" class="link underline">kamakiri</a> bootrom
                    exploit allows us to
                    bypass the signature, checking for the preloader bricking the preloader, so that the device is
                    temporarily unable to boot. This puts the processor into bootrom mode, allowing us to push a payload
                    to the memory that loads a patched preloader that doesn’t verify that the little kernel is signed
                    with the correct keys. However, this means it is a tethered exploit, as we are required to push the
                    patched preloader by USB.
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-size:32px" class="bold">How do we get root?</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                    Once we have booted a patched little kernel, we can access Amazon’s debug features, including
                    fos_flags. We can use fastboot to access these, just like previous root solutions for the Fire TV
                    stick, as seen below. We can enter fastboot mode by holding the Uber (circle) button upon boot.

                    These commands are not available when not on an engineering device, however, some flags persist
                    after restoring the device.
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-size:32px" class="bold">Security practices</h4>
                <p style="font-size:24px">
                    Once I had a root shell, I began to explore the device, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I
                    saw. For a device which initially cost £35/$46, there seemed to be several measures built into the
                    device to prevent misuse. To start with, the LED underneath the mute button cannot be disabled using
                    software; it is controlled by the OS, but can only be enabled from a root shell and not disabled.
                    This means that if an attacker were to remotely access your Echo, they would be unable to listen in,
                    provided it is on mute. There is also a process which filters logs before they are uploaded to
                    ensure there is no sensitive information; this is a huge improvement from older Kindle devices which
                    were known to upload <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=51371"
                        class="link underline">exact GPS
                        location</a>
                    and is much more privacy-friendly. Processes use a tool called <a
                        href="https://arkq.github.io/openlipc/" class="link underline">LIPC</a> to communicate just like
                    the
                    linux-based kindles of 15 years ago. LIPC appears to be a dbus-based system which allows
                    inter-process interaction, and it appears that this is being slowly replaced with a seemingly
                    identical version called <span style="font-size: 24px;color: #FF2D2D;">aceipc</span>.
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-size:32px" class="bold">Conclusion – Is this Dangerous? </h4>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                    I have added a script into the <a href="https://github.com/Dragon863/EchoCLI">code repository</a>
                    which allows somebody to run a web server and
                    covertly receive recorded audio over the internet using a bash script, with the LED ring appearing
                    to be enabled to be in the mute state. If this exploit were untethered, that could be a relatively
                    significant issue, but thanks to the good practices of Lab126 during the design process, this would
                    not be possible to start on
                    boot. For most customers, the existence of this rooting solution should not be a big issue. It would
                    take considerable technical knowledge and physical access for a moderate period of time for an
                    attacker to be able to carry out this attack. Using a cable like <a
                        href="/media/usb_splitter.jpg">this</a> prevents the need for
                    a computer once the device is booted, but the attack is still very impractical. However, this does
                    present some excellent opportunities for anybody looking to liberate their devices and explore
                    custom software. I have added an example to make the Echo into a smart LED-indicator on the code
                    repository linked at the top of this post, and I’m sure the community will create more with this in
                    the future. With the low cost of older Echo speakers on the second hand market, I can see it
                    becoming a useful little device with several community projects. I feel that it is safe to release
                    the code for my exploration, as according to Amazon’s customer support page <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GMZQWNQRVENX4GTQ ">here</a>,
                    the 2nd generation
                    Echo Dot no longer receives security updates, and is not in scope for their bug bounty program.
