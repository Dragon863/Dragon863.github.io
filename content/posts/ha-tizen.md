 This is a small, unofficial companion app written using flutter-tizen to control lights and switches using Home Assistant. I created it because I wanted to use Home Assistant on my tizen watch which is no longer officially supported by Samsung, and wanted there to be a way to control devices without manually typing out tokens.
