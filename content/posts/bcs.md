I recently designed and developed a website for a local computer shop in Southport, England. The website, Birkdale Computers, offers computer repair and data recovery services. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is fully responsive for optimal viewing on all devices. It is built using the [bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework and includes a google maps integration to help customers find the shop easily.
